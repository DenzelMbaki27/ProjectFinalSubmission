                <h3>Group Youtube Channel</h3>
                <p>I bet you guys are wondering what is an SYT? or who is SYT? well i'm here to tell you. SYT is a Youtube group that I am in as it stands we have 1.42k subscribers our goal is too takeover youtube and show who is going to be the biggest one out. I co created this group back in August 2021, but our very first video was released July 2024 that video was our biggest video standing at 1.6k views but our recent video that has been released and is offically number one standing at 1.7k views.</p>

                <h3>Gaming Quiz</h3>
                <p>This right here is a Gaming Quiz That I made for my Javascript class I'm happy that it came it out all as you can see there was a lot of CSS styling and a lot buttons that are used for the questions, once you get the right it turns green and if you get it wrong it turns red. This project took a while but it led to a perfect mark.</p>

                <h3>Group Sports page</h3>
                <p>So this right here is a Sports page that I did for Javascript this was an Group Project this by far has been my favourite project done the entire semest because Ive never been in a group like that school wise so we put in a lot of effort into this. As you see it clearly stands out has a lot of styling, hovering buttons, the sports link that you can click and also share to anyone also a cool feature which is darkmode/lightmode.</p>
