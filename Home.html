            <h2>About My Journey</h2>
            <p>
               If i'm not mistasken I am the youngest student in almost each class especially here in Web programming, the journey to even get accepted here at Humber College was by far crazy. I needed a Math credit for each program I applied for at Humber at the time I didn't even know about it all my semesters were full with different Classes, so I fought to get 
               Math on my timetable and it worked and I passes and now i'm finally here.

            <h2>My favourite quote</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "The calmer you are, the clearer you think. Move with strategy, not emotions."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This Quote was sent to me by my dear mom. During my first week here at Humber college I was going through a lot because this whole enviroment was very different and I felt like I couldn't handle it, My mom was the only one who knew about it and she was kind enough to be by my side and proceeded to provide this great quote.
